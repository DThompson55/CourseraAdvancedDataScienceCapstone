# Coursera Advanced Data Science Capstone
In which our hero examines data from NYC and NOAA to determine the effect of weather on non-emergency 311 calls.

## notebooks

- Weather_Affect_on_311NYC.data_exp.ipynb - This reads in the original 311 data file, which is HUGE. and cuts it down to size.
- Weather_Affect_on_311NYC.etl.weather_data.ipynb - cleanup, joins, etl type stuff.
- Weather_Affect_on_311NYC.feature_eng.ipynb - early feature extraction, top ten lists of 311 call types

- Visualize_1.ipynb - Initial Weather Visualization
- Visualize_2.ipynb - Visualization where I firts identifyied the Weekend Effect
- Visualize_Weather.ipynb - Rain, Snow, Wind, etc.

- Model_2.ipynb - Performs Linear Regression on Weather Data, Plots results
- Model_3.ipynb - Linear Regressions that show failed attempts to correlate against certain weather types
- Model_3a.ipynb -  Linear Regressions that show failed attempts to correlate vs wind
- Model_4.ipynb - Clusrter Analysis
- Model_5a_DL.ipynb - Deep Learning
